I received my B.Sc. degree (2007) and Ph.D. degree (2013) in Chemistry from Zhejiang University, China, under the supervision of Prof. Qi Wang. I also minored in English during the undergraduate period. From 2014 to 2015, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher under Prof. Thijs J. H. Vlugt at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. I joined Zhejiang University of Science and Technology in 2015. My research involves using computer simulation and machine learning to bring molecular modelling to real industrial and medical applications, with the ultimate goal of material and drug discovery.

In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and language learning. I also spend a certain amount of time each week on triathlon training (swim, bike, run).
