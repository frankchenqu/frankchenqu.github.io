# Research Interest
### I am currently using computer simulation methods and machine learning approaches to study the following topics:

1. Developing and advancing theories in diffusion and adsorption in nanopores

2. Carbon capture with conventional physical and chemical solvents

3. transmembrane and transdermal drug delivery as well as drug-target interaction prediction
