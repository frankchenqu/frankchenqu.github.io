Research Thrusts
## Current
### Resolving Mononuclear Transition Metal Space
I leverage data in the [Cambridge Structural Database
(CSD)](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-core/components/csd/) to interrogate mononuclear
transition metal chemistry - [bridging experiments, simulations, and machine
learning](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.0c01458).

## Past and Current
### Atomically-Precise Nanoclusters
I apply [Density Functional Theory](http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.pdf) towards understanding and predicting the stability, stoichiometry, and morphology of atomically-precise metal and semiconductor nanoclusters. More recently I have been focusing on III-V semiconductor nanocrystals.
I previously developed a [thermodynamic stability theory](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15988) rationalizing precise Au-nanoclusters, and towards prediction of their [targeted doping](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b02679).

## Past
### Nanoalloy Energetics
Lead efforts in [developing a model](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b00670) based largely on [early metal energetics theory](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.28.665). we are working on rapid computational screening of the [catalytic applications of nanoalloys](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaax5101.abstract). The goal of this work was to move towards new nanoalloys for targeted applications.

### Kidney Stone Growth Inhibition
I worked on methods to understand and rationalize inhibition of kidney stone growth by a number of modifiers. Our [work](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19062) was published in **Nature** and a [follow-up work](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.8b00945) highlighting other modifiers was recently published!
