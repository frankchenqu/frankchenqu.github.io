**I am currently using computer simulation methods and machine learning approaches to study the following topics:**

*(1) Developing and advancing theories in diffusion and adsorption in nanopores*

There usually lack experimental data on diffusion and adsorption of fluids in defect-free carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which feature hollow interior and smooth surface. However, mathametical and computational models can be utilized to predict the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of fluids inside pristine and modified CNTs. This part of the work can be extended to other nanomaterials and enhance our understandings of fluid transport in confined spaces.

*(2) Carbon capture with conventional physical and chemical solvents*

Understanding CO<sub>2</sub> absorption and diffusion in physical solvents (e.g. propylene carbonate) and chemical solvents (e.g. monoethanolamine) is essential to develop the next generation of solvents that are affordable and recyclable. Computer simulation often serves as a tool to predict physical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> in the solvents, providing insights into industrial applications. However, with existing force fields, mixing rules, and simulation approaches, the accuracy of the simulation results still needs significant improvement. Conventional methods combined with machine-learning approaches are expected to address this issue.

*(3) Transmembrane and transdermal drug delivery as well as drug-target interaction prediction*

Drug delivery and discovery is at the heart of scientific community around the world. It is quite challenging to model transmembrane and transdermal drug delivery due to the structure complexity of skin barriers and cell membranes. Multiscale approaches are therefore badly needed, such as Coarse-Grain modelling, metadynamics and QM/MM methods. Also, when physics-driven results meet data-driven perspectives, the process of drug and material discovery is likely to be accelerated.
