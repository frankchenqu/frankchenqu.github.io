# Research Interest
**I am currently using computer simulation methods and machine learning approaches to study the following topics:**

(1) Developing and advancing theories in diffusion and adsorption in nanopores

(2) Carbon capture with conventional physical and chemical solvents

(3) Transmembrane and transdermal drug delivery as well as drug-target interaction prediction
