## Web Content
[molSimplify Lite](https://molsimplify.mit.edu/) - web-based inorganometallic design.

**Description:** Contributed interactive plots and extended diversity of structure-building
capabilities of the molSimplify online viewer - powered by Flask and Javascript.

**Description:** Nanoclusters (very small metal nanoparticles) represent an exciting newer class of nanoparticles that are being used in applications from drug delivery to catalysis. Towards developing a better understanding of their stability we have developed a [new theory](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15988). In this video we explain this new theory and describe its significance. 
## Journal Covers

**Description:** Our [work](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b02679) on heterometal doping in atomically-precise ligand-protectect nanoclusters  was highlighted as both a [cover](https://pubs.acs.org/toc/jpclcd/9/23) and [spotlight](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b03570) in JPCL. Very excited to have the work highlighted!

**Description:** I made and designed this cover for the [work](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b03459) of my collegue, Natalie Austin, highlighting the imposed 3D-nature of gold sub-nanometer catalysts by the presence of adsorbates.
