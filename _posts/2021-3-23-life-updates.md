I am a researcher interested in bringing molecular/materials modeling and data-driven discovery to
real and emerging materials. In practice, this looks like extending tailored featurizations for
inorganometallic chemistry, testing generalizability of artificial neural network models to
experimental chemistries, and digging deeper into the physics behind it all. Beyond
chemistry-related applications I have broader interests in asking data-related questions of the
world. I aspire to always be working on things that matter by attempting to make what I'm
working on matter.
